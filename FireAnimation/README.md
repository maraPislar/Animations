# Fire Animation

To animate a fire you can use a particle system which is either predefined or you can generate 
each particle as the programme runs. The above programme uses the second method.

From this fire animation it's easy to silumate smoke, you just have to change some 
colors and some properties.

To compile:

javac --module-path=**<path-to-javafx-sdk-11.0.2-lib>** --add-modules=ALL-MODULE-PATH Main.java

To run:

java --module-path=**<path-to-javafx-sdk-11.0.2-lib>** --add-modules=ALL-MODULE-PATH Main

Enjoy the aesthetic :)
